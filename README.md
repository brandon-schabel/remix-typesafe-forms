# Remix Fullstack Type Safety With Form Validation and Type Safety

This is a demo project that demostrates full end to end type safety with Remix.

- SQLite for simple and easy database setup
- Prisma for DB
- remix-validated-form, zod, zod-form-data for fullstack form validation.
- tailwind for styling

This project is a simple blog that demonstrates my favorite way to get an effective full stack type safety system
with a robust validation system using remix-validated-form with zod.

## Setup

If you don't have SQLite setup you can set it up using
`brew install sqlite`

then install dependencies
`pnpm install`

update `.env.example` to `.env`

update .env if needed

run project
`pnpm run dev`
